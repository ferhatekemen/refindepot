                                    <p><span>Latin origin CV “Curriculum Vitae” is used in the same context as French Resume in many countries, but it differs significantly, especially in the USA and Canada (excluding Quebec Region). In these countries, CV is a definition used mostly for academic purposes and it means a more detailed resume. A "Resume" is usually expected to be 1, or 2 pages in the maximum. On the other hand, "CV" is usually 2 pages but, can also be more. Especially, CVs of people with a long academic career can reach up to five or six pages since they include all of their academic publications as well.</span></p>
                                    <p><span>Therefore, the document used in undergraduate applications in North America is ‘Resume’. The document used in graduate applications is a CV or Resume according to the program applied for. The document used in business life is a Resume unless the application is for a high-level professional position or an academic post. The important thing here is not what we call the document. Since the receiver knows very well what the document is prepared for, there is no need to add a title in the form of CV or Resume. The important thing is to take CV writing rules into account while preparing a CV, and Resume writing rules when preparing a resume. These two definitions can be used interchangeably in many countries except America and Canada and in the Canadian province of Quebec. So outside of North America (excluding Quebec), we can say; CV = Resume.</span></p>

                                    <p>Almost all professional and academic sources state that a cover letter is required with the resume when making an application. In our opinion, the most important point in the presentation of a cover page is its purpose and other documents that are presented along with it. The scope of this letter written for a professional or academic position and for an academic program application will naturally differ from each other and it is due to the difference in the additional documents provided with it. <br><br> For professional positions, the cover page is an important document accompanying the resume. Researches show that a complementary cover letter addressed to the institution along with the resume is viewed positively by human resources departments. The cover letter used in applying to academic/professional positions supports your suitability for the applied position and serves as a presentation tool as well as a document where you can include details about your skills and abilities that could not be elaborated due to space limitations in your resume. Instead of emphasizing how much you want the job, include tangible elements, such as numerical data, that can prove what and how you can contribute to the job. It is necessary to avoid clichés and exaggeration in writing any cover page, and to avoid listing qualities and abilities that are not supported by accurate examples. <br><br> The cover page presentation differs in academic program applications. Although we observe that the use of cover pages in academic applications - except for doctoral programs - is not common and absence of it does not create a serious problem, we believe that this page is of great importance especially for some applications. For example, a student who wants to participate in a free summer research project can make his/her application stand out among hundreds of candidates who apply only with a resume, by including a cover page explaining more about his / her reasons and experiences. If the cover page will be presented when applying for a master's degree, it is necessary to avoid repetition of the information written in the curriculum vitae, personal letter, and in the intent letter that are listed in that application. The cover letter is rarely mentioned in the list of required documents for graduate applications. For some academic applications in Europe, a separate motivation letter is not required with the resume, but only a cover letter can be requested. In this case, this cover page acts as a motivational letter as well. The reason why we want to point these out is the terms like "motivation letter", "statement of purpose", "cover letter" and "personal statement" can be confusing sometimes. The success of an application is linked to a good understanding of what is meant by the document. The correct document is the one required by the institution applied for. The same document may have been used in another context elsewhere. The point here is to deliver what the institution applied for requires. <br><br> As we mentioned before, the factors that will determine the content of the cover page are its purpose and what other documents are presented with it. Some specific academic programs list the cover page among the required documents. When we take a look at the "MSc. Technology and Policy" graduate program at MIT: <br> http://tpp.mit.edu/academics/apply/ <br> <em>(The information was last updated on our portal: April 2020)</em> <br> We see quite clearly that the application to the program expects a cover page. Therefore, it is important to know the expectations of the institution to apply for about cover page. If you are unsure about what to write on the cover page, you can get information about the content by contacting the person in charge of the program. <br> Various CVs and cover page examples prepared by various academic sources are available as supplementary documents along with the links to the origin of these sources on our portal.&nbsp;</p>
